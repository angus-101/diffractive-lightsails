# diffractive-lightsails
Final year project modelling diffractive lightsails

My project partner and I used a discrete dipole approximation implementation (ADDA) and an evolutionary algorithm framework (DEAP) to model and optimise the design of a sail that would propel a spacecraft by diffracting incident light.

We also used SCOOP to parallelise the computation by dividing up the dipole calculations between computer cores. This was run on BlueCrystal Phase 4, a university supercomputer that runs on Linux, allowing the use of up to 500 cores.
